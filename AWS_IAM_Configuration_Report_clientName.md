# 🔐 AWS IAM Setup & Security Hardening Report

**Client:** [Client Name]

**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

**Prepared by:** Hexterika Cyberlab (Sangsongthong Chantaranothai)

---

## 0. Executive Summary

This report documents the IAM configuration and security measures implemented in the client's AWS account. The objective was to establish a secure foundation aligned with AWS best practices for identity management, least privilege access, and strong authentication.

### Key Highlights

- IAM users structured via groups and roles
- MFA enforced for all users
- Root account protected and isolated
- Secure password policy configured
- Clear user onboarding documentation provided

---

## 1. Methodology

The following steps were completed during the engagement:

1. **Root Account Configuration**
    - Verified MFA and access key settings
    - Separated billing access where applicable
2. **IAM Group and Role Setup**
    - Created Admin, Developer, Finance groups
    - Assigned AWS-managed policies to groups
3. **User Creation and Access Control**
    - Created IAM users and assigned to appropriate groups
    - Enforced password reset at first login
    - Enabled MFA for each user
4. **Password & Access Key Security**
    - Configured password policy (length, complexity, rotation)
    - Disabled unused access keys and root access key
5. **Verification**
    - Tested access boundaries of user roles
    - Ensured billing access and admin privileges are separated

## 2. Observations & Notes

| Observation | Severity | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Root account login restricted, but still enabled | Low | Avoid using root for daily operations |
| IAM group “Admins” has full access | High | Acceptable for this tier; future org should segment further |
| Password policy enforces complexity and expiry | ✅ | Aligned with AWS best practices |
| No CloudTrail or access logging enabled | Medium | Recommend enabling CloudTrail if not already active |

---

## 3. IAM Best Practices Reference

- ✅ Enforce MFA on root and all users
- ✅ Use groups, not direct user-policy attachment
- ✅ Apply AWS-managed policies unless advanced access control needed
- ✅ Rotate access keys if programmatic access is used
- ✅ Avoid daily use of root account
- ✅ Enable CloudTrail and consider Config for monitoring
